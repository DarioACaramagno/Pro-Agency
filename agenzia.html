                Impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking in record collection.
                However, within illustration, our main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours.

                        Now, alongside founding a feminist creative collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, complex and accessible imagery which would be as at home in an ad campaign as it would be in a children’s book (which she's quite keen to try soon).
